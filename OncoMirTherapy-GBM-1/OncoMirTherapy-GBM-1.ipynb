    "# Article Title: Anti-seed PNAs targeting multiple oncomiRs for brain tumor therapy[@wang2023anti], \n",
    "\n",
    "# Importance : \n",
    "Brain tumors represent a critical medical challenge due to their high lethality. This research explores the modulation of a complex gene network by two microRNAs (miRNAs) and examines the effects of targeting these miRNAs on gene expression. Additionally, it highlights the potential of using short (8-mer) γ-modified peptide nucleic acids (PNAs) as an indirect method to modify gene expression, offering promising avenues for future gene therapy.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Conclusion: \n",
    "Our findings indicate that bioengineered nanoparticle systems (BNPs) carrying anti-seed γ-modified peptide nucleic acids (sγPNAs) targeting various oncogenic microRNAs (oncomiRs) offer a viable strategy for enhancing glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) therapy. This approach also holds the potential for tailoring treatments to individual patients by targeting tumor-specific oncomiRs[@wang2023anti]\n",
